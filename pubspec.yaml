# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/staht_logo.png
    - assets/beep.wav
    - assets/staht_logo_green.jpg
    - assets/driving_pin.png
    - assets/destination_map_marker.png

    - assets/aje.png
    - assets/lastSt.png
    - assets/folder.png
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/svg/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/poppins.otf

    - family: SF Pro Display Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/sf_pro.ttf
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
    - family: Open Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/opensans.ttf
